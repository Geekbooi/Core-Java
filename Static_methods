#The main method is a special method thats always called authomatically by the JVM when you excute an app
#You must call other methods explicitly to tell them to perform their tasks
#We dont have to use object when using static methods, for example when excuting main methods we dont declare an object
 it can get with the class but for other non static methods we use object ref. for excution. For exmaple. 
	Scanner input = new scanner(system.in);
	String name = input.nextLine(); // to use the nextLine method we use an object ref (input)

	String a = input.nextLine();
	int age = Integer.pasrseInt(a); // Integer is a class (we didnt created an object with the name "Integer") and pasrseInt 
	is a static method, coz we call the method with its class and we use this line of code to change the 
	string input to a integer data type
	math.pow(3,2); // pow is a static method which is called with its class "Math"
	Class Math is a part of the java.lang package whic is impicitly imported by the complier
#This case is explained as
	ClassName.methodName(argumets)

#If we call a method with its class without creating an object is a static method, and if we call it with an object ref it's non-static method
#Classes that are compiled in the same directory are considered to be in the same package known as the default package
#Classes in the same package are implicitly imported into the source-code files of other classes in that package

#Related classes are typicaly grouped into packages so that thet can be imported into programs and reused
#Java API provides a rich collection of predefined classes that contain methods for performing string manipulations,
 input/output operations, databse operations, networking operations(socket programming), file processing, error checking
 and other ready made operations
