#Java performs method call through stack operation. i.e pulling and pushing operation
#Stacks are known as lastin-firstout, when a program calls a method, the called method must know how to return to its caller,
 so the return address of the calling method is pushed onto the method-call stack.

#the method call stack also contains the memory for the local variabls used in each invocation of a method during a program's exection.
 this data, stored as a portion of the method-call stack is called the stack frame of the method call.
#if there are method call operations a stack frame for this method performs a push or pull operation
#As a compter's memory is finite, so only a certain amount can be used to store stack frames on the method-call stack
 if more method calls occur than can have their stack frames stored, an error known as a "stack overflow" occurs.

#you can create an object in the method declaration parameter // but this object function only in the method definition
