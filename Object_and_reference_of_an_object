#when creating a variable or a reference of an object - it is the address that the object or the method resides/stored.
#so we are not using objects when we assign an object to a variable it's just we are using references to these variables

#so reference of an object means is to link to an object with its address	
	Scanner input = new Scanner(system.in) // there is a class/object called Scanner and we created a reference/address of an object with 
			the "new" object having a size of Scanner. And make this reference object to read strings from keyboard (system.in)
	
	test input = new test() // the test object has an address in the memory and we are creating "input" as the reference to that object,
	        	which points to the memory location
	
	int [] C = new int [10] // As int datatypes have 4 byte memory allocation the reference of that array will only take the first 
		     byte from the first 4 byte size

#Immutable object - an object whose contents can't be changed
	String class is an immutable class and string objects are immutable object
	
	Immutable classes have  -All data fields must be private
				-There can't be any setter methods
				-No getter methods can return a data fields that is mutable, if the getter methods returns an object, this should be immutable
