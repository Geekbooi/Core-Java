#Every object uses system resources - MEMORY
#we need a disciplined way to give resources back to the system when they are no longer needed
otherwise, "resource leaks" might occr tat prevent resources from being reused by your program
#JVM perform automatic garbage collectotion to reclain the memory occupied by objects that are no longer used.
#Every class in java has the methods of class object (package java.lang), which is called finalize.
we should never use method finalize, because it can casue many probelms and there's uncertainity as to whether it will ever 
get called before a program terminates.
