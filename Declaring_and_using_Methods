public static void student(string name, string sex, int age) //these are called parameter
	object.setname(name); // name is an argument
	object.setsex(sex); // sex is an argument
	object.setage(age); // age is an argument

#arguments are in method call and parameters are in definition
	string teacher = student(string n, string s, int age) // these are arguments, as they are called from the above method definition
#it is wrong to initialze a variable as public static void student(double x, y, z) // it should be as 
	public static void student (double x, double y, double z) 

#There are 3 ways to call a method
	1. using a method name by itself to call another method of the same class
	2. using an object ref. follwed by a dot for Non static method - also we called them instance methods
	3. using class name and a dot to call a static method
