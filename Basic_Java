	Properties and features of Java
Robust - Provide great exception handling framework out of the box to build a resilient application
Object-Oriented - Everythings are objects
Platform Independent - Write once run anywhere
Strong Type-checking - Force us to respect the data type
Compile and Interpret
Garbage Collector - Automatically find unused object and variables and remove them from the memory
Multithreading - Like gaming app can allow multithreading app
Secure - No pointers/ no memory or reference leaks

JDK-    when installing a JDK, it provide JDE and JVM
JRE -   Runs the .class file with the help of JVM and libraries
	-Runtime enviroment
	-The virtual machine inside the program 
JVM - 	it is the class libraries
	- compile, load, and excutes

#the command javac (the java compiler)compile a program, which convert the java source code to Bytecode(.class files), 
java compiler create and generate .class file
# then the bytecode are translated into machine language

#To run a java code we should at least have one class and one method (main)

#System.in - standard input for system in - allows to input character from user input
#A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color,
 and methods, such as drive and brake.

#o create an object of a class, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new
	Class_Name Obj = new Class_Name
