#An abstract class normally contains one or more abstract methods, and abstract method is an instance method with 
 keyword abstract in its declaration
		public abstract void draw ();
#We can declare abstract classes, at this time we can not create object ref. for them. They act as superclass
#these classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, coz they are incomplete
#otherclasses can extend them and overide them inorder to manipulate the abstract class methods 
#If the abstract class has a static method, we can call them through the method. "abstractclass.method"
#So we consider abstract classes as incomplete, so whoever extends absract classes is considered as complete/concrete class
 and the method that overide the abstract class method is called concrete
#Abstract classes are more general so we need to be more specific before we can create objects
#Concrete classes provide the specifics that make it reasonable to instantiate objects and it "should" complete the
 incompelte methods from the abstract methods
#Constructors and static methods cannot be declared abstract. Constructors are not inherited coz they are intialized
