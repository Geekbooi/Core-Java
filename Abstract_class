#An abstract class normally contains one or more abstract methods, and abstract method is an instance method with 
 keyword abstract in its declaration
		public abstract void draw ();
#We can declare abstract classes, at this time we can not create object ref. for them. They act as superclass
#these classes cannot be used to instantiate/create objects, coz they are incomplete. but we can declare variables that can hold references to objects of any subclass 
derived from those abstract superclasses.
#otherclasses can extend them and overide them inorder to manipulate the abstract class methods 

#If the abstract class has a static method, we can call them through other st atic method. "abstractclass.method"
#So we consider abstract classes as incomplete, so whoever extends absract classes is considered as complete/concrete class
 and the method that overide the abstract class method is called concrete

#Abstract classes are more general so we need to be more specific before we can create objects
#Concrete classes provide the specifics that make it reasonable to instantiate objects and it "should" complete the
incompelte methods from the abstract methods

#Constructors and static methods cannot be declared abstract. Constructors are not inherited coz they are intialized
#Since abstract methods are meant to be overridden, it would notmake sense to declare a static method as abstract.

#Failure to implement a superclass's abstract methods in a subclass is a compliation error unless the subclass is also declared abstract.
